# ðŸš€ Asynchronous JavaScript: Promises, Async/Await, and AJAX

This lecture covers one of the most powerful features in modern JavaScript: **asynchronous programming**.

In real-world applications, many operationsâ€”like fetching data from a serverâ€”take time. JavaScript handles these tasks **asynchronously**, allowing the rest of the code to continue running without being blocked.

## ðŸ§  What You'll Learn

- Why asynchronous code is important  
- Working with **Promises**  
- Making HTTP requests using the **`fetch()` API**  
- Writing cleaner async code with **`async/await`**  
- Proper **error handling** in async flows  
- Real-world use cases such as **AJAX** requests  

By the end of this lecture, you'll be equipped to write modern, non-blocking JavaScript that handles background tasks effectively.
